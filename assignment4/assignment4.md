## Challenge 1: Unique Word Counter

Write a Python program that takes a paragraph of text as input and counts the number of unique words.
Ignore case and punctuation. Return a dictionary where keys are unique words, and values are their respective frequencies.

### Steps:
- Prompt the user to enter a paragraph of text.
- Convert the text to lowercase and remove punctuation.
- split text to words
- Write a function that takes a text string as input and returns a dictionary containing unique words and their frequencies.
- Print the dictionary of unique words and their frequencies.

Example:
```sh
Enter a paragraph of text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks, and the fox runs away."
Output: {'the': 4, 'quick': 1, 'brown': 1, 'fox': 2, 'jumps': 1, 'over': 1, 'lazy': 1, 'dog': 2, 'barks': 1, 'and': 1, 'runs': 1, 'away': 1}
```

## Challenge 2: Matrix Transposition

Write a Python program that takes a matrix (2D list) as input and returns its transpose.
The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows and columns.

### Steps:
- Prompt the user to enter a matrix as a list of lists.
- Write a function that takes a matrix as input and returns its transpose.
- The input and output matrices should be displayed in a readable format.
- Print the original matrix and its transpose.

Example:
```sh
Enter a matrix (each row on a new line, numbers separated by space):
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Original Matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Transposed Matrix:
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
```
